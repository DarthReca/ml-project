# Machine Learning Project

## Modules

**data_loading**: Load test data and training data

**data_plotting**: It contains function to plot data in various way

**models**: It contains all classes of models

## Notes

### Gaussian Model

- After preprocessing can be obtained better results (~0.4 accuracy)
- Data of pulsar and non-pulsar are not well separated
- Linear models will not achieve good result because they are not linearly separable
- Preprocessed data are more or less a Gaussian

### Linear Regression

### Support Vector Machine
